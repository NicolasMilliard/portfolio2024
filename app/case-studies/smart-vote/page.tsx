          SmartVote allows users to organize their own voting instances, add
          users to a whitelist, create proposals, and tally votes. It works on
          the Polygon and Avalanche blockchains. In general, SmartVote is
          designed to work with any public or private EVM (Ethereum Virtual
          Machine) blockchains.

          The front-end development of the project involves Next.js for web
          development, Rainbow Kit for linking to the user&apos;s digital
          wallet, and Ethers.js for blockchain communication. Wagmi.sh is
          integrated to streamline blockchain connectivity and serve as a global
          state manager.

          The blockchain development utilizes Hardhat, a platform for smart
          contract development, with some contracts implementing the EIP-1167 (

          ). Additionally, the smart contracts are pausable to enable users of
          the dApp to propose the &quot;deletion&quot; of a voting instance
          (since classic deletions are impossible on the Blockchain), and they
          are upgradeable to allow cloning and registration of a new contract
          owner.

          Security features are provided by OpenZeppelin, Chai is used for unit
          testing, and Eth-gas-reporter tracks gas costs on the blockchain.
          Solidity Coverage measures code coverage during unit tests. Finally,
          to streamline the retrieval of events recorded on the blockchain, The
          Graph has been added to the project.

          The user can create and deploy a new voting instance, add users to a
          whitelist, create proposals, and tally votes. The user can also view
          the voting instance details, including the number of proposals, the
          number of votes, and the number of users in the whitelist.

              VotingFactory.sol allows the creation of voting instances in
              accordance with EIP-1167. While it adds an additional cost of 700
              gas per iteration, EIP-1167 simplifies the VotingFactory contract
              and greatly reduces deployment costs;

              VotingHandler.sol serves as a reference to the clones created by
              VotingFactory. This smart contract contains all the logic for
              voting sessions, including adding voters, adding proposals,
              counting votes, and managing second rounds. Additionally,
              VotingHandler is upgradeable to enable cloning and registration of
              a new contract owner. Moreover, it is pausable to propose to smart
